## setting it up:

You can use either `conda` or `mamba` (mamba is faster). You can also do it with your favorite env manager + `pip`.

`mamba install ipyleaflet numpy ipycytoscape ipyvolume pythreejs bqplot jupyterlab -c conda-forge`


I recommend using jupyterlab >= 3, if you're using something inferior or jupyter notebook please check each package page on how to make it work.
