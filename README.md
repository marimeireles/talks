I'll think it's cool if you contact me to tell me about your talk if I inspired you or if you're using my material somehow. I'll also be super happy to share my speaker notes or just reviewing your talk if you need :)

Note that some of the stuff that's here doesn't belong to me and it's licensed correctly, you still have to obey these other licenses.
